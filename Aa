2. You will see `You'll need to sign in to your Slack account to create an application` and sign in to your slack account

3. Click on the `create new app` button.

4. You will see a `create an app` dialog. Select `From an app manifest button`.

5. Select your workspace where you want to install the slack app and proceed `Next` .

6. Edit this [manifest.yaml](./documentation/slackManifest.md) according to your needs, copy and paste, then proceed `Next` and  `Create` .

## Install Slack App into your workspace

# Facebook App Integration

## Create A Facebook User

> SlackBook server needs an user token of a facebook user to call facebook graph apis . You can use your own facebook account user token but it is recommended to create an organizational facebook user account. Ex: Cefalo HR 

## Create A Facebook App

1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/ , sign up as a developer using your desired facebook user. 

2. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/create/ , select `None` , proceed `Next` 

3. Enter app display name ( Ex: SlackBot), contact email and then click `Create App`

4. Go to your app Settings > Basic , Enter any live valid URL in Privacy Policy ( Ex: `https://www.cefalo.com/en/`) , click `Save changes`and then switch on to live by toggling in development button on top.

5. Now again toggle from live to in development.
    <details>
      <summary> You are thinking what we are actually doing   here, right?</summary>

  
    > Okay, let me explain (You can skip anyway).Facebook doesn't allow users to see posts in development mode posted by graph api in a group, if the user is not a developer, administrator, tester, or analyst of the used facebook app . So we need to switch to live mode. After swtiching on to live mode, we don't have all the permission scopes by default that we get in development mode. We need `publish_to_groups` permission to post in group using graph api. So, either we need to submit privacy policy, business policy and other documents to facebook to review our app and grant us our required permission in live mode, or we could switch back to our development mode to use the permisson scopes we need. But does that solve our first problem? Posts not visible to all users? Yes, it does somehow. After switching once to live mode, you can than switch back to development and stay like this, but now all the posts, attachments, files are visible except direct photos. Still we can post photos as an attachment preview which is visible to all. Is that a facebook bug? But it offers us a great deal.

# Data Flows
## Events
![slackbook data flow](files/facebook.png)

According to our manifest.yaml configuration, our Slack Bot will be subsrcibed to message events of public channels and bot inbox. All the messages will be forwarded to our SlackBook server by slack server. Then our SlackBook server will do some processing and post on facebook group. 

## Commands

![slackbook data flow](files/weather.png)

Maybe you want to perform some action/api calls without sending a message in public channel. In this case slack command subscription will help you creating custom commands and perform your desired actions. In our case, we have created a /weather command in our configuration that hits a specific route of our SlackBook server which is responsible for fetching weather data of the current time near Cefalo Bangladesh Limited and send back a formatted response which won't be able to be seen by others.

# Limitation and Difficulties

## Difficulties:

1.

<br>

# Process of Posting Data from Server to Facebook
<br>

## Posting Status without Link and Attachments in Facebook\

<br>

 - System catches the event passed in slack using a slack app called **slackbot**.

 - It checks whether the event is a **message** type . If it is a message type event , then system moves to the next step .
  
 - Then the system checks if the message contains any file . If the message doesn’t contain any file then the system moves to the next step .         

 - Now the system checks whether the text field of the message contains any link . If it doesn’t contain any link, the system moves to the next step.

- Now it’s the final step for the system to call the Corresponding Endpoint of Facebook API . Credentials to Post a Status without Links and Attachments are : 

<pre>

  Method Name: POST
  API Endpoint: https://graph.facebook.com/{group_id}/feed/
  Parameter: message = {message_you_want_to_share}
  Facebook App: SlackBot
  Token Type: User Token
  Access Token : generated access token in graph api explorer in facebook
  Permission Scope :  1. publish_to_groups  2. public_profile 

</pre>

<br>

## Posting Status with Links in Facebook
  
  <br>

 - System catches the event passed in slack using a slack app called **slackbot**.

 - It checks whether the event is a **message** type . If it is a message type event , then system moves to the next step .

 - Then the system checks if the message contains any file . If the message doesn’t contain any file then the system moves to the next step .

 - Now the system checks whether the text field of the message consists of any link . If it  contains any link, the system moves to the next step.

 - Now it’s the final step for the system to call the Corresponding Endpoint of Facebook API .Credentials to Post a Status with Links are :

 <pre>

  Method Name: POST
  API Endpoint: https://graph.facebook.com/{group_id}/feed?link={link_you_want_to_share}
  Parameter: message = {message_you_want_to_share}
  Facebook App: SlackBot
  Token Type: User Token
  Access Token : generated access token in graph api explorer in facebook
  Permission Scope :  1. publish_to_groups  2. public_profile 

</pre>

- **Limitations** : Facebook doesn’t allow one user to share more than one link on Facebook . Other Links including  the first one will remain in the message as a link but will not be shared . That’s Why systems passess the first link in the link parameter but all the links will remain in the message .

<br>

## Posting Status with Photo in Facebook

<br>

 - System catches the event passed in slack using a slack app called **slackbot**.

 - It checks whether the event is a **message** type . If it is a message type event , then system moves to the next step .

- Then the system checks if the message contains any file . If the message  contains any file then the system moves to the next step .

- Then system checks how many files are attached with the event . If there are multiple files then system can’t post this in facebook because facebook doesn't allow one to post multiple files in facebook . So , If there is only one file then the system will move to next step.

- Now system makes the url of the file  in the slack server public . For this system uses a method which takes the user token of bot and file id of file as arguments .

- Now system checks if the file type is an image . If the file type is image then system moves to the next step.

- System scraps the image url with extension from the public url and saves it .
- Now it’s the final step for the system to call the Corresponding Endpoint of Facebook API .Credentials to Post a Status with photos are :

<pre>

 Method Name: POST 
 API Endpoint: https://graph.facebook.com/{group_id}/photos?url={image_link_with_extension} 
 Parameter: message = {message_you_want_to_share}
 Facebook App : SlackBot
 Token Type: User Token
 Access Token : generated access token in graph api explorer in facebook
 Permission Scope :  1. publish_to_groups  2. public_profile 

</pre>
- **Limitations** : Can not post multiple photos using this endpoint because the parameter **url** takes only one link .

<br>

## Posting with Attachment Except photo in Facebook

<br>

 - System catches the event passed in slack using a slack app called **slackbot**.

 - It checks whether the event is a **message** type . If it is a message type event , then system moves to the next step .

- Then the system checks if the message contains any file . If the message  contains any file then the system moves to the next step .

- Then system checks how many files are attached with the event . If there are multiple files then system can’t post this in facebook because facebook doesn't allow one to post multiple files in facebook . So , If there is only one file then the system will move to next step.

- Now system makes the url of the file  in the slack server public . For this system uses a method which takes the user token of bot and file id of file as arguments .

- Now system checks if the file type is an image . If the file type is not an image then system moves to the next step.

- Now it’s the final step for the system to call the Corresponding Endpoint of Facebook API .Credentials to Post a Status with attachment except photo are :

<pre>
  Method Name: POST 
  API Endpoint: https://graph.facebook.com/{group_id}/feed?link={public_link_of_the_file_in_slack_file_server}
  Parameter: message = {message_you_want_to_share}
  Facebook App: SlackBot
  Token Type: User Token
  Access Token : generated access token in graph api explorer in facebook
  Permission Scope :  1. publish_to_groups  2. public_profile 

</pre>
- **limitations** : Can not post multiple files because Facebook doesn’t allow one user to post multiple files .
